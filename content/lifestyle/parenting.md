Give all the opinions as suggestions; we shouldn't take the decision for them

All they need from the parents is TIME!!!

Letting them ask questions without any reservations on whom to ask and what to ask initially. Gradually, help them understand what is appropriate. Thinking loud and making them feel that it is okay to not understand things and be open about it. There is nothing inferior about not know anything in this world. It is all matter of time and interest.
