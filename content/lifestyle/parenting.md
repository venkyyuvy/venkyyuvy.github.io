Give all the opinions as suggestions; we shouldn't take the decision for them

All they need from the parents is TIME!!!

Letting them ask questions without any reservations on whom to ask and what to ask initially. Gradually, help them understand what is appropriate. Thinking loud and making them feel that it is okay to not understand things and be open about it. There is nothing inferior about not know anything in this world. **It is all matter of time and interest**.

Advantages of enabling kids to ask questions-

1. once we were in a restuarant (all three of us). A server came near to us get orders. My wife and I were discussing what to order, suddendly a question from my son (Nachu) in a soft voice:

    > Both of you always like IDLY right, then order that! why are you discussing what to order?

2. Nachu was telling met that ghost used to be there in forest only and not here (resident areas). Then, I told him that there is nothing called ghost in this world. It's all fake and don't even think of it. 

    > His immediate response, then why there is a word called GHOST in the first place?

   
3. I was carrying two biscuits and dipping the third one in the milk while I was walking near Nachu. He asked some help from me, so I sad down near him.He immediately noticed that there are two biscuits left in my hand, which means I ate more than 2 biscuits. He questions is

    > why are you eating more than 2 biscuits when you give me always 2 biscuits whenever I ask.
