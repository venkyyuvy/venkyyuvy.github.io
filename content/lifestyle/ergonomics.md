NO poster is ideal so that it can be maintained for long hours or consistently for many days. Constantly changing the poster is a good trick to make sure, we are not straining a certain parts of our body.

Few rule of thumbs that I gathered over the years:

- Keep the two - third (2/3) of the screen/monitor above the eye-level. (Learned this very useful tip from [Flavio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavio-livide-430430/?originalSubdomain=ie))
- Make sure your foot is grounded on some surface so that the leg maintains 90 degrees with the floor.
- Fore arms must also make 90 degrees inclination with the trunk of our body.

My personal preference is not using the MOUSE a lot, while writing or doing programming. Hence, I am still in love with VIM key bindings everywhere.
