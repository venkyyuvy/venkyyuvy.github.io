Hi!!!


Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Venkatachalam Natchiappan. I am currently working as a senior data scientist in Ericsson. 
My strengths are Machine learning, operations research and software engineering.
Prior to the current role, I was working as a Data scientist in Machine learning, centre of excellence team of Ford's Global Data Insights and analytics team (GDIA). I have working on developing vehicle routing solutions using genetic algorithm, constraint programming in the OR space.
Building large scale customer interaction classification, NLP annotation tool along with active learning, survey analysis tool and probability of payment and defaulting model for Ford credit.

On the personal front, I live in Chennai, India, I am married and we have a four year old son. All time fan of Yuvraj Singh (Ex-Indian cricket team player). I have completed my bachelors degree in 2013 from College of Engineering, Guindy in manufacturing engineering. In 2014, I pursued masters of science (by research) in operations management for Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. My thesis is titled "minimizing the conflicting edges in graph coloring problem". This work concentrates on proposing novel heuristic for performing graph coloring when only a certain number of colors is allowed, whch is less the chromatic number of the graph. The study also compares the huristic's effectives, my measuring it's closes to an optimal solution identified using memetic algorithm.

I enjoy contributing something back to the open source community. I had done more than 15 successful pull request to Sklearn project. Also, I answer for machine learning and python specific questions in Stack Overflow. You can checkout my SO profile [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6347629/venkatachalam?tab=profile). I have more than 16K reputation points in the Stack Overflow.

I like coffee, trekking (NOT a fan of beaches!), enjoy playing Handball.
My recent interests are understanding large scale data engineering tools, building AI softwares.
