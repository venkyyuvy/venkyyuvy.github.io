## 1. Remote interference management
Graph based ML solution to observe and detect remote interference in 5G networks.

## 2. Network Milestone completion time estimation
Model trees to predict the time to complete different milestones of network rollout project.

## 3. Traffic classification in Packet core
Identify the mobile application and classifying the type of user actions (send/receive message, file transfer, voice or video calls) based on first few encrypted packets of TCP or UDP flow.

## 4. Quidditch
Inner source anomaly detection framework

## 5. AutoCOP
Computer vision solution to detect the proper installation of network component in the tower for closure of 4G installatin. Object detection methods such as Yolo, SSD and Faster RCNN were evaluated to arrive at the final solution.

## 6. NLP Tagging tool
Active learning augument tagging tool for NLP ML tasking labelling.

## 7. Survey analysis toolbox
LDA based topic modelling methods for open ended questions analysis from survey response.

## 8. Probability of payment and defualting
Building ML based payment likelihood models for US Ford credit customers.

## 9. Customer concern codes (CCC) and Vehicle Function Group (VFG) classification
Classifying the customer interactions into appropriate CCCs and VFGs using word embeddings

## 10. Dealer fraud detection

## 11.
