After a sudden plan of removing my wisdom tooth, which I had been delaying for more than 6 years. On that day, I couldn't able to drive the car to Chennai. I requested my friends to suggest any acting-drivers for driving our car from Mayiladuthurai to Chennai. Initially, one friend called me back and said he found someone, who would charge 2K for it. I took a back seat because I didn't expect this much charge for 250 Kms drive rather I was expecting around 1000 to 1500. After few minutes, same friend call me back and then said there is another guy who can come for 1500 rupees. I was happy that I could save 500 rupees. 

While travelling, what actually happened was that the acting driver hit something on the highway and blasted the tyre. We had to spend close to an hour in the highway to change the wheel with the stepney. I took the car for repairing damaged wheel and came to know that both the disk and tyre was damaged, which needs to be replaced. The Disk costed 1500, temporary tube costed 350 and then warranty replacement of the damaged tyre costed around 700. 

What initially seemed to be savings option for me, ended up being additional cost of 2500!
