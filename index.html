My name is Venkatachalam Natchiappan. I am currently working as a senior data scientist in Ericsson.
My expertise are Machine learning, Deep learning, operations research and software engineering.
Prior to the current role, I was working as a Data scientist in Machine learning, centre of excellence team of Ford's Global Data Insights and analytics team (GDIA). I have working on developing vehicle routing solutions using genetic algorithm, constraint programming in the OR space.
Building large scale customer interaction classification, NLP annotation tool along with active learning, survey analysis tool and probability of payment and defaulting model for Ford credit.</p><p>I have completed my bachelors degree in 2013 from College of Engineering, Guindy in Manufacturing engineering, then pursued masters in science (by research) in operations management for Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
Title of my research thesis is minimizing the conflicting edges in graph coloring problem. This work concentrates on proposing novel heuristic for doing graph coloring when number of allowed colors is less the chromatic number of the graph. Compares it effectives based on close to optimal solution using memetic algorithm.
On the personal front, I am married to Kamalasubha and we have a four year old son (Arun Nachiappan), based out of Chennai, India. All time fan of Yuvraj Singh (Ex-Indian cricket team player).</p><h1>Passion</h1>I enjoy contributing something back to the open source community. I had done more than 15 successful pull request to Sklearn project. Also, I answer for machine learning and python specific questions in Stack Overflow. You can checkout my SO profile
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/6347629/venkatachalam?tab=profile">here</a>. I have close to 15K reputation in the Stack Overflow.
I like coffee, trekking (NOT a fan of beaches!), enjoy playing Handball.
My recent interests are understanding large scale data engineering tools, building AI softwares.<br><br>Last updated: Jul 2023<br><h1>Latest posts</h1><div class=posts-list><div class=post><p><div class=date>Jun. 11, 2023</div><h1><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/blogs/delayed_gratification/ title="Cons of too much delayed gratificaiton">Cons of too much delayed gratificaiton</a></h1>Why too much of delayed gratification is an issue? Someone can become good at delayed gratification but too much of delay / deffering it is a big problem. He / she may not be able to enjoy at the moment of gratification even when gratification happens after the desire amount of delay. The only thing that gives them happiness is delaying the gratification longer and longer - for anything at any point of anytime.</p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Jan. 16, 2023</div><h1><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/blogs/savings/ title=Savings>Savings</a></h1>After a sudden plan of removing my wisdom tooth, which I had been delaying for more than 6 years. On that day, I couldn&rsquo;t able to drive the car to Chennai. I requested my friends to suggest any acting-drivers for driving our car from Mayiladuthurai to Chennai. Initially, one friend called me back and said he found someone, who would charge 2K for it. I took a back seat because I didn&rsquo;t expect this much charge for 250 Kms drive rather I was expecting around 1000 to 1500.</p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Oct. 31, 2022</div><h1><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/blogs/corporate_experience/ title="Ireland culture">Ireland culture</a></h1>One person in an online meeting says that he is going to get married. The reaction from rest of the members in the team: - I hope this is your first time! - Take good number of days off man, one don&rsquo;t get to do these things often!!
When the person come back to office after the wedding, questions asked by the team members were,
- Am I right in saying that you were married now?</p></div></div><h1>Latest photos</h1><div class=image-grid><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/photos/trekking/ title=Trekking><img src=/photos/trekking/IMG_huec6b8e49cae291366dffa7658586b2f4_2282967_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt=IMG.jpg class=img-responsive></a>
