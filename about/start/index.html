Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Venkatachalam Natchiappan. I am currently working as a senior data scientist in Ericsson. All time fan of Yuvraj Singh (Ex-Indian cricket team player). My strengths are Machine learning, operations research and software engineering. Prior to the current role, I was working as a Data scientist in Machine learning, centre of excellence team of Ford&rsquo;s Global Data Insights and analytics team. I have working on developing vehicle routing solutions using genetic algorithm, constraint programming in the OR space."></head><body class=terminal><div class=container><div class=terminal-nav><header class=terminal-logo><div class="logo terminal-prompt"><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/ class=no-style>Venkatachalam</a>:~#

My strengths are Machine learning, operations research and software engineering.
Prior to the current role, I was working as a Data scientist in Machine learning, centre of excellence team of Ford&rsquo;s Global Data Insights and analytics team. I have working on developing vehicle routing solutions using genetic algorithm, constraint programming in the OR space.
Building large scale customer interaction data classification, NLP annotation tool along with active learning, survey analysis tool, probability of defaulting model for credit team.
On the personal front, I am married and I have a three year old son, based out of Chennai, India.</p><p>I have completed my bachelors from College of Engineering, Guindy in Manufacturing engineering, then pursued my masters (by research) in operations management for Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. My thesis is Minimizing the conflicting edges in graph coloring problem. This work concentrates on proposing novel heuristic for doing graph coloring when number of allowed colors is less the chromatic number of the graph. Compares it effectives based on close to optimal solution using memetic algorithm.</p><p>I enjoy contributing something back to the open source community. I had done more than 15 successful pull request to Sklearn project. Also, I answer for machine learning and python specific questions in Stack Overflow. You can checkout my SO profile <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/6347629/venkatachalam?tab=profile">here</a>. I have close to 15K reputation in the Stack Overflow.</p><p>I like coffee, trekking (NOT a fan of beaches!), enjoy playing Handball / Cricket.
My recent interests are understanding large scale data engineering tools, building AI softwares.</p><p>Last updated: May 2022</p><h2 id=license>License</h2><p>Copyright Â© 2020 <a href=https://github.com/venkyyuvy>Venkatachalam Natchiappan</a></p><div class=footer>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> with
