<h1>Hi!!!!</h1>


<p>

Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Venkatachalam Natchiappan. I am currently working as a senior data scientist in Ericsson. 
My expertise are Machine learning, Deep learning, operations research and software engineering.
Prior to the current role, I was working as a Data scientist in Machine learning, centre of excellence team of Ford's Global Data Insights and analytics team (GDIA). I have working on developing vehicle routing solutions using genetic algorithm, constraint programming in the OR space.
Building large scale customer interaction classification, NLP annotation tool along with active learning, survey analysis tool and probability of payment and defaulting model for Ford credit.

<p>
I have completed my bachelors degree in 2013 from College of Engineering, Guindy in Manufacturing engineering, then pursued masters in science (by research) in operations management for Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
Title of my research thesis is minimizing the conflicting edges in graph coloring problem. This work concentrates on proposing novel heuristic for doing graph coloring when number of allowed colors is less the chromatic number of the graph. Compares it effectives based on close to optimal solution using memetic algorithm.
On the personal front, I am married to Kamalasubha and we have a four year old son (Arun Nachiappan), based out of Chennai, India. All time fan of Yuvraj Singh (Ex-Indian cricket team player).
