A server came near to us get orders. My wife and I were discussing what to order, suddendly a question from my son (Nachu) in a soft voice:<blockquote><blockquote><p>Both of you always like IDLY right, then order that! why are you discussing what to order?</p></blockquote></blockquote></li><li>Nachu was telling met that ghost used to be there in forest only and not here (resident areas). Then, I told him that there is nothing called ghost in this world. It&rsquo;s all fake and don&rsquo;t even think of it.<blockquote><blockquote><p>His immediate response, then why there is a word called GHOST in the first place?</p></blockquote></blockquote></li><li>I was having two biscuits in my hand and dipping the third one in the milk while I was walking near Nachu. Suddenly, he asked some help from me, so I sad down near him. He immediately noticed that there are two biscuits left in my hand, which means I ate more than 2 biscuits. He questions is<blockquote><blockquote><p>why are you eating more than 2 biscuits when you give me always 2 biscuits whenever I ask.</p></blockquote></blockquote></li></ol><div class=footer>Copyright Â© 2023<a href=https://github.com/venkyyuvy>(Venkatachalam Natchiappan)</a></div></div></body></html>
