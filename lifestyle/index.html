I had my first injury to left knee during the zonal semi-finals match with REC (Rajalakshmi college of engineering), happened in our college (College of Engineering, Guindy). One opponent&rsquo;s knee hit my left knee on the medial side. Immediatley I felt a shock on my nerve and after that I couldn&rsquo;t continue my play on that match. On the same day, during the warmup for the final match - my left knee collapsed when I try to make a feint to Tamilvanan (who is standing as a defender for me) and took off for a shoot.</p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Jun. 11, 2023</div><h1><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/lifestyle/parenting/ title=parenting>parenting</a></h1>Give all the opinions as suggestions; we shouldn&rsquo;t take the decision from their place.
All they need from the parents is TIME!!!
Letting them ask questions without any reservations on whom to ask and what to ask initially. Gradually, help them understand what is appropriate. Thinking loud and making them feel that it is okay to not understand things and be open about it. There is nothing inferior about not know anything in this world.</p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Jul. 20, 2022</div><h1><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/lifestyle/ergonomics/ title=Ergonomics>Ergonomics</a></h1>NO poster is ideal so that it can be maintained for long hours or consistently for many days.

Few rule of thumbs that I gathered over the years:
Keep the two - third (2/3) of the screen/monitor above the eye-level. (Learned this very useful tip from Flavio) Make sure your foot is grounded on some surface so that the leg maintains 90 degrees with the floor.</p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Jan. 1, 0001</div><h1><a href=https://venkyyuvy.github.io/lifestyle/appreciation/ title></a></h1>Appreciation What is appreciation?
Anything that makes you feel better than the so called NORMAL.
when I walked into one of my school friends home, her father told me with a big smiling face that he liked the way I parked the car!!! There is nothing special or extraordinary about it. but still he wanted share his happiness with me.
