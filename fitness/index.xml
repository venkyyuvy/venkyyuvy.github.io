I had my first injury to left knee during the zonal semi-finals match with REC (Rajalakshmi college of engineering), happened in our college (College of Engineering, Guindy). One opponent&amp;rsquo;s knee hit my left knee on the medial side. Immediatley I felt a shock on my nerve and after that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue my play on that match. On the same day, during the warmup for the final match - my left knee collapsed when I try to make a feint to Tamilvanan (who is standing as a defender for me) and took off for a shoot.</description></item></channel></rss>
